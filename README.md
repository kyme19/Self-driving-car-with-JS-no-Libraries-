# Self-driving-car-with-JS-no-Libraries-
IGNORE THIS IS JUST FAULTY DESCRIPTION AN EXCUSE TO WHY THE PROJECT IS DEVELOPED.
AS THE PROJECT SOUNDS THAT IS ITS REAL DESCRIPTION.
A self driving car with no programming skills or libraries is possible, because of cutting edge technology. 
This project is built on top of this technology. It uses Javascript to control the car, but does not require any programming skills to operate.
This project is intended to show others how this technology works, and to inspire others to build their own self driving cars. 


// This project is still under development and will be updated sooner with more features in the future.
// P.S Any help to this project will be appreciated.
